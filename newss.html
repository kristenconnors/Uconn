    <p> Senior guard Saniya Chong has been selected in the third round of the 2017 WNBA Draft with the 26th overall pick by the Dallas Wings.  The Draft was held at Samsung 837 in New York City. Chong is the 33rd former Husky to be selected in the WNBA Draft since the league's inception in 1997. UConn has now had at least one player selected in the draft 18 times in the last 20 years. UConn did not have any seniors on its roster in 2003 or 2007. “I am truly blessed to be able to get this opportunity,” Chong said.  I am grateful and excited to start my new journey.  Thank you to everyone out there that supported me!” The Ossining, N.Y. native finished her career with 145 games played, including 43 starting assignments, 34 of which came during her senior season.  She posted 808 career points, 288 rebounds, 119 steals and 135 made three-point field goals. </p>
