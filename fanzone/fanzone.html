    <p> The 1940 Nutmeg, in a write-up on the University Band, notes that “the band with its snappy arrangements, especially of ‘The Husky Song,’ is an enjoyable part of all our athletic contests.” Everyone knows “The Husky Song,” right? Well, not this one. Not unless you were at the University between 1940 and the mid-1950s. Because the song referred to in the 1940 Nutmeg is not the song you think it is. What is now known as “The Husky Fight Song,” actually titled “UConn Husky,” was written sometime in the late 1940s by Herbert France, who started the music department. But that’s getting ahead of the story. It was in 1939 that Connecticut State College became the University of Connecticut. Although the Husky had been the mascot since 1934 – after Connecticut Agricultural College became CSC and the nickname Aggies no longer applied to our athletic teams – the use of “UConn” didn’t become widespread until the 1940s.
