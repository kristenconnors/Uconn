    <p> The Uconn Women's Basketball team is the most susseccful team in all of sports, including the proffesionals.
        Last season they won 111 games in a row..yeah thats right 111. And the last time they lost was in 2014...3 years ago.
        During those 3 years they have had players move up to the WBNA, and still get good enough recruits to keep up their success.
        Also during those years they won 4 consecutive titles, no one has ever won that much. THe Huskies are geat year after year. </p>
    <br>
    <p> They have the highest expectations out of any program in the NCAA, and probably even the pros. When you think
        of success you think of the Uconn Women's basketball team. </p>
    <br>
    <p>They have such a great work ethic and are the biggest force to be rekoned with in basketball. Girls who
        are young still growing up dream of playing for this team because you are guarranted to win, because that is
        just what they do and what they are known for.</p>
    <br>
    <p> "It is about doing it in a way that can't be done any better. That is the goal everyday" from the legend Geno.
        Geno has been with the huskies for so long, and he is the one responsible for the held success and titles. Him
        along with the coaching staff makes this team what it is, each and throughout every year so consitently. </p>
